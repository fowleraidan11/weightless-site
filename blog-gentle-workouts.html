    <h1>Gentle Workouts for Beginners</h1>
    <p>Embarking on a fitness journey doesn’t require intense sweat sessions.  For those new to exercise or returning after a break, gentle or low‑impact workouts are an excellent way to build strength, improve balance and gradually boost cardiovascular health without placing too much stress on your joints.</p>
    <p>Health experts emphasise that a balanced exercise program should include aerobic, muscle‑strengthening and balance activities.  Aerobic activity increases your breathing and heart rate and improves the health of your lungs, heart and circulatory system.  Meanwhile, flexibility and balance exercises help you move more freely and reduce injury risk.</p>

    <h2>Brisk Walking</h2>
    <p>Walking is one of the simplest and most accessible forms of exercise.  The UK National Health Service notes that walking briskly can help build stamina, burn excess calories and make your heart healthier.  You don’t need to walk for hours—a 10‑minute brisk walk counts toward the recommended 150 minutes of moderate‑intensity activity each week.  Start with comfortable shoes, increase your distance gradually and incorporate walking into daily routines, such as walking part of your commute or taking the stairs.</p>

    <h2>Stretching and Flexibility</h2>
    <p>Flexibility exercises allow your joints to move through their full range of motion.  Stretching helps maintain and improve flexibility, making it easier to exercise and perform everyday activities like tying your shoes or unloading the dishwasher.  Experts advise stretching once your muscles are warmed up—after aerobic or strength activities—and to breathe deeply without pushing to the point of pain.</p>

    <h2>Yoga</h2>
    <p>Low‑impact practices such as yoga improve flexibility and balance while offering relaxation benefits.  Gentle yoga or Hatha yoga focuses on slow stretches, breathing and deep relaxation, making it ideal for beginners and stress reduction.  There are many styles to choose from, so look for beginner‑friendly classes and modify poses as needed.</p>

    <h2>Pilates</h2>
    <p>Like yoga, Pilates uses low‑impact movement patterns to promote posture, balance, flexibility and core strength.  A typical routine can be tailored to your fitness level and often involves a series of mat exercises or the use of resistance machines.</p>

    <h2>Tai Chi</h2>
    <p>Tai chi is a form of moving meditation that involves slow, precise body movements that flow from one pose to the next.  It’s an effective way to improve balance and coordination and is especially safe and gentle for older adults.  Tai chi also helps relieve stress and encourages mindfulness.</p>

    <h2>Balance Exercises</h2>
    <p>Balance activities help prevent falls and injuries.  Examples include standing on one foot, heel‑to‑toe walks, walking backward or sideways and using a wobble board.  Aim for about three sessions of balance exercises each week, and use support (like a chair or wall) until you feel steady.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started Safely</h2>
    <p>Before starting a new exercise routine, talk to your doctor if you have any health conditions.  Warm up with gentle movements like leg kicks or arm swings and cool down afterward with light activity and stretches.  Drink plenty of water, listen to your body and stop if you feel pain.  By choosing activities you enjoy and building up gradually, you’ll be more likely to stick with your fitness journey.</p>
