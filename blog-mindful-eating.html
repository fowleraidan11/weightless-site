      <p>Mindful eating isn’t about strict rules or cutting out your favorite foods — it’s about changing your relationship with eating so you enjoy meals and naturally support weight loss. By slowing down and paying attention, you can prevent overeating and make healthier choices without feeling deprived.</p>

      <h2>What is Mindful Eating?</h2>
      <p>Mindful eating means being fully present during meals. Instead of eating on autopilot, notice taste, texture and satisfaction with each bite. This helps you tune into natural hunger and fullness cues.</p>

      <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Better portion control</strong> — eating slowly gives your brain time to register fullness.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced emotional eating</strong> — awareness helps separate real hunger from stress or boredom.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved digestion</strong> — unrushed meals are easier on your system.</li>
        <li><strong>Greater satisfaction</strong> — you enjoy food more and feel less restricted.</li>
      </ul>
